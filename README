CCD Training - Open Closed Principle - Arithmetic Parser

This project contains a parser for arithmetic expressions, that can be evaluated.

The classes LexicalAnalyzer and ArithmethicParser are used for parsing.
The resulting classes Term, Operator and Variable for evaluation.
The classes in the ui package provide a ui that can be used for manual tests.

Adding an additional operator type does not work out of the box with clean code
because the effects of operators are hardcoded in switch statements all over
the code.

Goal:
Refactor the Operator class using the strategy design pattern to be abstract with
implementations so that adding a new operator simply involves creating a new 
implementation and registering it.
